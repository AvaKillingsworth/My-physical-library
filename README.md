About this project

I put all of my books into a spreadsheet. 
I asked myself some questions like: 
- How many books do I own?
- How many books have read each year?
- Total vs. average pages read each year.
- What genres do I usually read?
-etc.
I had a lot of fun doing this and I will update every time I get or read a new book.
Thank you and I hope you enjoy what you see.
